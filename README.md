JRayX
=====
This project was originally started just for fun way back in university with some colleagues of mine. The goal was to improve our programming and math skills by writing a simple ray-tracer.

It seems a colleague spent some time afterwards working on the code some more and put it onto google code (though I cannot find the project any more now, which is what I used as a basis for my work).

What I did:
- naive conversion from Java to C#
- changing code to use C# features
- removal of "optimizations"
- some restructuring (which is ongoing)
- unifying internal data structures (colors, vectors)
- naive octree implementation (colleague's is way faster but uninteligble to me)
